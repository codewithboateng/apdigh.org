class ImpactAssessor(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess the impact level of a bill provision for each topic area.

    Base your assessment on what the provision actually requires, prohibits, or enables.
    Compare against rule of law principles and international democratic standards (GDPR, OECD guidelines,
    Commonwealth constitutions, ECHR, ICCPR).

    IMPORTANT: Assess the CURRENT PROVISION (current_provision field) based on its direct impact. Adjacent
    provisions (preceding_provisions and following_provision) are provided as context to understand how
    provisions relate and affect each other.

    Consider adjacent provisions when the current provision's impact depends on or is modified by what
    adjacent provisions establish or omit. Focus on direct functional relationships between provisions.

    Procedural provisions (repeals, commencement, savings clauses) should be assessed on their own direct
    effects, not the broader bill's substantive content.

    Evaluation framework - assess both compliance AND enhancement:
    - RULE OF LAW: Legal certainty, non-arbitrariness, equality before the law, judicial independence
    - FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE: Presumption of innocence, right to fair trial, no punishment without law
    - SEPARATION OF POWERS: Checks and balances, independent oversight, no concentration of incompatible roles
    - PROPORTIONALITY: Penalties proportionate to harm, necessity, least restrictive means
    - DUE PROCESS: Notice, hearing, appeal rights, independent review before coercive action
    - DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY: Transparency, parliamentary oversight, limits on executive power

    Rate based on deviation from OR improvement upon established democratic norms. Consider both problems and benefits.

    Impact levels (neutral):
    - neutral: No meaningful impact on this topic area

    Impact levels (positive):
    - low-positive: Minor beneficial changes or improvements to existing frameworks. Routine enhancements.
    - medium-positive: Within the range of good democratic practice with beneficial procedural refinements or
                       safeguards. Standard good governance practices such as adding appeal rights, establishing
                       clear procedures, or requiring transparency. Common beneficial approaches found in well-
                       functioning democratic jurisdictions.
    - high-positive: Significant improvements over international best practices that exceed norms in most OECD
                     countries. Establishes beneficial protections, streamlined processes, or institutional safeguards
                     that go beyond what is typical in functioning democracies. Examples: Strong privacy protections
                     exceeding GDPR, independent oversight bodies with teeth, explicit protections for researchers/
                     journalists, streamlined market entry reducing barriers.
    - severe-positive: Fundamental enhancements of rule of law principles or international human rights standards.
                       Provisions that would be studied as constitutional best practice in established democracies
                       or exemplify core principles such as:
                       * Judicial independence (strong institutional protections)
                       * Proportionality (well-calibrated incentives and safeguards)
                       * Legal certainty (clearly defined rights and obligations)
                       * Due process (robust hearing and review mechanisms)
                       * Separation of powers (independent oversight + clear accountability)
                       * Market freedom (removal of unnecessary barriers, enabling innovation while maintaining
                         essential safeguards, precedent-setting practices that balance rights and innovation)

    Impact levels (negative):
    - low-negative: Minor administrative or technical changes with negligible practical impact. Routine
                    adjustments to existing frameworks.
    - medium-negative: Within the range of democratic practice but missing some procedural refinements or
                       safeguards. Common regulatory approaches that may be on the stricter end but are found
                       in some democratic jurisdictions. Standard government powers (licensing, exemptions,
                       enforcement) that lack optimal oversight but don't represent fundamental departures.
                       Note: Distinguish between licensing for regulated activities (finance, healthcare, aviation
                       operations) which is standard, versus licensing requirements that extend beyond regulated
                       activities to capture general market participation or information provision.
    - high-negative: Significant departures from international best practices that exceed norms in most OECD
                     countries. Creates substantial barriers, compliance burdens, or discretionary powers that,
                     while not fundamental rights violations, go beyond what is typical in functioning democracies.
                     Includes government licensing requirements that restrict market entry for activities that are
                     typically unregulated in democracies (e.g., requiring licenses to provide publicly available
                     information or data services).
    - severe-negative: Fundamental violations of rule of law principles or international human rights standards.
                       Provisions that would be struck down as unconstitutional in established democracies or
                       violate core principles such as:
                       * Judicial independence (enforcer profits from enforcement)
                       * Proportionality (criminal penalties for administrative matters)
                       * Legal certainty (undefined criminal offenses)
                       * Due process (coercive action without hearing or review)
                       * Separation of powers (investigator + prosecutor + beneficiary in same entity)
                       * Government infrastructure control (mandatory use of government-controlled infrastructure
                         for private business operations, without precedent in OECD democracies, especially when
                         combined with penalties that include license revocation or business exclusion)

    Topic areas (consider both harmful and beneficial provisions):
    - Digital Innovation: Tech startups, market entry facilitation/barriers, innovation enablers/obstacles, compliance streamlining/costs, safe harbors/chilling effects
    - Freedom of Speech: User protections/content monitoring, speech safeguards/censorship mechanisms, journalist protections/platform regulations
    - Privacy & Data Rights: Data protection strengthening/weakening, retention limits/requirements, user rights/government access, privacy safeguards/surveillance
    - Business Environment: Reduced barriers/operational costs, simplified procedures/compliance burdens, flexibility/data localization, market access/market barriers
